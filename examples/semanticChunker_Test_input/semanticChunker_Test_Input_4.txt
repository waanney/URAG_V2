Modern smartphones can be grouped into three categories:
1. Flagship devices: high-end hardware, multiple cameras, and premium materials.
2. Mid-range devices: balanced performance and price, good battery life.
3. Budget devices: basic features for essential tasks.

Consumers choose based on price, performance, and ecosystem.
