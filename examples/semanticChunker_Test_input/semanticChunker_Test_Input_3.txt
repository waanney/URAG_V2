Climate change refers to long-term shifts in temperatures and weather patterns. 
These shifts may be natural, but since the 19th century human activities have been the main driver. 
Burning fossil fuels releases greenhouse gases that trap heat in the atmosphere. 
To mitigate climate change, governments and individuals can reduce emissions, switch to renewable energy, and protect forests. 
However, mitigation requires coordination, money, and political will.
