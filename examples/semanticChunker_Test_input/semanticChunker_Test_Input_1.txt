Artificial Intelligence (AI) is a branch of computer science. 
It focuses on creating machines that can perform tasks that normally require human intelligence. 
Examples include problem-solving, language understanding, and learning from experience. 

AI can be divided into two main categories: 
1. Narrow AI, which is designed for a specific task such as voice assistants. 
2. General AI, which aims to perform any intellectual task that a human can do. 

AI has many applications today. 
For example, in healthcare it assists with diagnosis, in finance it detects fraud, and in transportation it powers self-driving cars. 
However, AI also raises concerns about privacy, job displacement, and decision-making transparency.
