Linked List is basically chains of nodes where each node contains information such as data and a pointer to the next node in the chain. It is a popular data structure with a wide range of real-world applications. Unlike Arrays, Linked List elements are not stored at a contiguous location. In the linked list there is a head pointer, which points to the first element of the linked list, and if the list is empty then it simply points to null or nothing.
In this article, we will provide a complete introduction of Linked List, which will help you tackle any problem based on Linked List.
Basic Terminologies of Linked List
Head: The Head of a linked list is a pointer to the first node or reference of the first node of linked list. This pointer marks the beginning of the linked list.
Node: Linked List consists of a series of nodes where each node has two parts: data and next pointer.
Data: Data is the part of node which stores the information in the linked list.
Next pointer: Next pointer is the part of the node which points to the next node of the linked list.
